# InterviewSelect

## Overview
InterviewSelect is a two-sided marketplace that expands on interview.io by enabling freelance interviewers to monetize their expertise while helping companies source vetted technical interviewers on demand. The platform combines transparent freelancer profiles, direct booking flows, and built-in interview tooling to deliver an end-to-end hiring augmentation solution. This repository aggregates product requirements, architecture decisions, and deployment practices that guide the future implementation.

## MVP Scope (Phase 0)
The `main` branch now contains a minimal viable prototype that validates the core registration-to-discovery loop without introducing payments or live interview tooling. The goal of this milestone is to prove out the microservice boundaries, AWS integration strategy, and baseline UI/UX before investing in the broader roadmap.

### Components
- **Frontend** (`frontend/`): Vite + React SPA with routes for the dashboard, profile read/edit views, and a static interviewer list that mirrors the Marketplace Service response.
- **User Service** (`backend/user-service/`): TypeScript Lambda handlers for registration (Cognito sign-up + DynamoDB persistence), profile retrieval, updates, and deletion.
- **Marketplace Service** (`backend/marketplace-service/`): Stub Lambda that returns a curated list of interviewers to validate discovery flows.
- **Infrastructure** (`infrastructure/`): Serverless configuration stubs and IaC notes for wiring API Gateway → Lambda → DynamoDB.

### Data Plane
- **Authentication**: AWS Cognito user pools with email/password sign-up. Profiles are tagged via custom attributes referencing DynamoDB identifiers.
- **Storage**: DynamoDB `interviewselect-users` table tracks freelancer and company metadata. Profile image upload targets S3 (left optional for this phase).
- **APIs**: API Gateway exposes RESTful endpoints that proxy to individual Lambda functions per route.

### Local Development
1. Install dependencies via npm workspaces: `npm install` at the repository root.
2. Run the React dev server: `npm run dev --workspace interviewselect-frontend`.
3. Execute unit tests: `npm run test:unit --workspace user-service`.
4. Launch LocalStack (Docker) and run integration tests: `npm run test:integration --workspace user-service`.

Additional setup instructions, including example AWS profiles, are documented in `docs/deployment-guide.md`.

## Core Capabilities
- **Freelancer registration and profiles**: Interviewers publish rich profiles with LinkedIn links, certifications, prior employers, years of experience, domains (system design, ML, etc.), configurable per-interview pricing, and synced availability calendars.
- **Company discovery and selection**: Hiring teams create organizational profiles, browse a searchable interviewer directory, and filter by expertise, experience, ratings, pricing, and real-time availability.
- **Booking and scheduling**: Companies select interviewers, define interview topics (e.g., "React frontend with scalability focus"), and finalize bookings via integrated calendars with automated reminders and rescheduling.
- **Interview execution**: Built-in WebRTC audio/video rooms include a shared coding editor, whiteboard, chat, and optional anonymous modes for candidates or companies.
- **Post-interview reporting**: Automated scorecards, structured interviewer notes, feedback summaries, and securely shared recordings streamline evaluation and knowledge retention.

## Differentiators and USP
Unlike traditional Interview-as-a-Service providers that assign interviewers algorithmically, InterviewSelect operates as a transparent marketplace where companies directly select freelancers. This democratizes access to niche expertise, gives freelancers control over pricing, and accelerates hiring decisions with verifiable credentials and holistic tooling across the interview lifecycle.

## Key Enhancements Beyond interview.io
- Anonymous mock sessions and diverse interview templates adapted for company-led assessments.
- AI-assisted feedback summaries, coaching recommendations, and dynamic scoring matrices.
- Marketplace mechanics (variable pricing, availability visibility, escrow payments) that empower freelancers and companies alike.

## Extended Feature Roadmap
- AI-powered interviewer recommendations based on hiring history, candidate profiles, and past performance.
- Ratings and reviews with dispute resolution to build marketplace trust.
- Escrow payment handling with automated payouts after interview completion.
- Integrations with ATS/HR systems (Lever, Greenhouse) for seamless report ingestion.
- Analytics dashboards exposing interviewer effectiveness, ROI metrics, and predictive hiring insights.
- Support for collaborative multi-interviewer panels with shared note-taking.
- Automated credential verification (e.g., blockchain-backed certifications).
- Mobile-first apps with offline-friendly interview experiences.
- Diversity, equity, and inclusion tooling, including bias-detection in feedback.
- Learning marketplace extensions for coaching bundles and preparatory materials.
- Compliance suite with GDPR/CCPA tooling and auditable recording logs.
- Gamified onboarding flows and profile completion incentives.

## Requirements Summary

## Architecture Overview
InterviewSelect employs a serverless microservices architecture on AWS:
- **Frontend**: React (TypeScript) SPA hosted on S3 with CloudFront CDN.
- **API Gateway**: Routes authenticated requests (AWS Cognito) to service lambdas.
- **Services**:
  - User Service for registration and profile management (DynamoDB storage).
  - Marketplace Service for Elasticsearch-backed search and SageMaker-powered recommendations.
  - Booking Service orchestrating calendar sync (EventBridge), Stripe payments, and availability conflict checks.
  - Interview Service leveraging AWS Chime SDK for WebRTC sessions, shared editors, and whiteboards.
  - Reporting Service managing transcripts (Transcribe), report assembly, and S3 asset storage.
  - Analytics Service aggregating metrics via Athena and Kinesis streams.
- **Integration Layer**: SNS/SQS for event-driven workflows, Step Functions for interview/reporting orchestration, and Secrets Manager for credential handling.
- **Observability & Security**: CloudWatch metrics, AWS X-Ray tracing, WAF protection, IAM least-privilege roles, and DynamoDB/S3 encryption.

## Low-Level Design Highlights
- TypeScript-based Lambda services with Joi validation, structured Winston logging, and Polly.js-backed circuit breakers for external API resilience.
- DynamoDB streams synchronize profile updates to Elasticsearch; idempotent booking transactions avoid double-booking.
- WebSocket endpoints manage session lifecycles with anonymous-mode toggles and latency-aware handling.
- Reporting pipeline uses SQS and Step Functions for asynchronous transcript generation and PDF assembly.
- Comprehensive testing strategy: Jest unit tests (>85% coverage), LocalStack integration tests, Cypress end-to-end flows, and Artillery load testing for core APIs.
