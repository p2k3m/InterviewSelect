# InterviewSelect Requirements Specification

## 1. Project Overview

### Objective
InterviewSelect will deliver a serverless, microservices-driven marketplace that enables freelance interviewers to monetize their expertise while giving companies a transparent, self-service way to discover, book, and collaborate with vetted technical interviewers.

### Stakeholders
- **Freelancers (Interviewers)**: Domain specialists who offer paid interview services.
- **Companies (Hirers)**: Hiring teams seeking experts to conduct bespoke interviews.
- **Platform Administrators**: Staff responsible for verification, compliance, and support.

### Scope
The platform covers user registration, profile management, marketplace discovery, booking and scheduling, real-time interview execution, post-interview reporting, payments, analytics, and administrative controls.

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1 Authentication and Authorization
- Support email/password login and social authentication via Google and LinkedIn OAuth.
- Assign users a role (`freelancer`, `company`, `admin`) with role-based access control enforced via JWTs.
- Provide secure session management with multi-factor authentication for administrators.

### 2.2 Freelancer Profile Management
- Create and edit detailed profiles including bio, years of experience, domains of expertise, past employers, LinkedIn URL, and certifications.
- Upload verifiable certifications or credentials; store assets securely with access logging.
- Configure tiered pricing (e.g., standard vs. premium rates) and define time-based availability with calendar synchronization (Google Calendar or iCal feed).
- Publish interview formats (system design, ML, coding, etc.) and preferred candidate seniority levels.

### 2.3 Company Workspace Management
- Register company accounts with organization details, billing contacts, and team member invites.
- Manage teams with granular permissions (viewer, scheduler, billing manager).
- Store hiring goals, interview templates, and job requisition metadata to drive interviewer recommendations.

### 2.4 Marketplace Discovery
- Search interviewers by keyword, skills, certifications, years of experience, industries, pricing, languages, and time zones.
- Filter by availability windows (e.g., next 7 days), ratings (e.g., >4.5), and price thresholds (e.g., <$100 per hour).
- View complete freelancer profiles, including ratings, testimonials, interview statistics, and recorded introductions.
- Receive AI-powered recommendations based on company hiring history, candidate profiles, and past interview outcomes.

### 2.5 Booking and Scheduling
- Step-by-step booking flow: select interviewer → choose date/time → define interview focus → confirm duration and participants.
- Integrate calendars for both parties; automatically detect conflicts and suggest alternate slots.
- Support automated reminders, rescheduling requests, and cancellation policies with configurable penalties.
- Handle payments via Stripe-backed escrow: pre-authorize company payment, release funds after interview completion minus platform fee (10–15%).

### 2.6 Interview Execution
- Provide WebRTC audio/video rooms with screen sharing, session recording, and bandwidth adaptation.
- Embed collaborative tools: Monaco-based code editor, whiteboard (Fabric.js or equivalent), shared notes, and chat with moderation controls.
- Enable anonymous modes for candidates or companies when confidentiality is required.
- Track interview timing, participant attendance, and any technical issues encountered.

### 2.7 Post-Interview Reporting
- Collect structured interviewer feedback using customizable scorecard templates.
- Generate automated transcripts via AWS Transcribe and summarize outcomes with AI assistance.
- Produce skill matrices, pass/fail recommendations, and highlight flagged concerns.
- Store recordings and reports in S3 with signed URL distribution (default 7-day expiry) and audit trail logging.

### 2.8 Payments and Monetization
- Maintain escrow balances, platform fee calculations, and payout schedules.
- Provide dashboards for freelancers to monitor earnings, pending payouts, and taxation documents.
- Support refunds, disputes, and chargebacks with workflow escalation to administrators.

### 2.9 Analytics and Insights
- Deliver dashboards showing booking volumes, conversion rates, interviewer performance, and ROI metrics.
- Offer predictive analytics (e.g., time-to-fill forecasts) driven by historical data and AI modeling.
- Allow data export to CSV and integrations with business intelligence tools.

### 2.10 Integrations and Extensibility
- Integrate with Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) such as Lever and Greenhouse for automatic report ingestion.
- Provide REST and webhook APIs for external systems to trigger bookings or retrieve reports.
- Offer marketplace add-ons for coaching bundles, preparation kits, or subscription tiers.

### 2.11 Administrative Controls
- Admin dashboard for user verification, credential validation, and dispute handling.
- Audit logs covering authentication attempts, booking changes, and data access events.
- Configurable policies for data retention (e.g., delete recordings after 90 days unless extended).

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Performance and Scalability

- Implement fine-grained IAM policies and network-level protections with AWS WAF.

### 3.3 Reliability and Availability
- Target 99.9% uptime with multi-AZ deployments and automated failover.
- Apply circuit breakers, exponential backoff retries, and dead-letter queues for resilient workflows.
- Monitor SLIs (latency, error rate) and enforce SLO/SLA commitments with alerting.

### 3.4 Usability and Accessibility
- Build a responsive UI optimized for mobile and desktop with WCAG 2.1 AA compliance.
- Provide intuitive onboarding, guided tours, and contextual help content.

### 3.5 Data Privacy and Compliance

- Maintain immutable audit trails and legal hold capabilities for investigations.

### 3.6 Observability
- Centralize structured logging, metrics, and traces with correlation IDs across services.
- Provide dashboards and alerts via CloudWatch, X-Ray, or equivalent observability tooling.
