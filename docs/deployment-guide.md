# InterviewSelect Deployment Guide

The following 60 steps outline best practices for building, testing, and deploying InterviewSelect on AWS using a serverless-first approach with GitHub Actions and the Serverless Framework.

## Repository Setup and Prerequisites (1–10)
1. **Initialize Repository**: Create the `interviewselect` GitHub repository with a root `.gitignore` covering `node_modules`, build artifacts, and `.env` files.
2. **Branch Strategy**: Adopt trunk-based development with protected `main` and feature branches validated via pull requests.
3. **GitHub Secrets**: Add `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, and other credentials under *Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions*.
4. **Fail-Fast Checks**: Configure workflows to abort if required secrets are missing by checking environment variables at the start of each job.
5. **Node.js Tooling**: Install Node.js 20 LTS and the Serverless CLI globally (`npm install -g serverless`). Verify with `node -v` and `serverless --version`.
6. **Package Manager**: Use `pnpm` for workspace management. Run `pnpm install` with the `--frozen-lockfile` flag in CI.
7. **TypeScript Baseline**: Initialize shared `tsconfig.json` files with `"strict": true` to enforce type safety across services and frontend.
8. **Linting and Formatting**: Configure ESLint with the Airbnb TypeScript config and Prettier integration; add Husky pre-commit hooks for `lint` and `format` commands.
9. **Documentation**: Maintain architecture diagrams (Mermaid) and API documentation within the repo (`/docs`) to align teams.
10. **Semantic Versioning**: Enable `changesets` to manage version bumps and generate changelogs for tagged releases.

## Backend Development (11–25)
11. **Service Scaffolding**: Use `serverless create --template aws-nodejs-typescript` within `/services/<service-name>` directories to bootstrap Lambda services.
12. **Shared Libraries**: Place reusable types, utilities, and DTOs in `/shared`; publish via `pnpm` workspace packages.
13. **DynamoDB Modeling**: Define single-table schemas with partition keys on entity IDs and GSIs for alternate access patterns (e.g., bookings by interviewer).
14. **Validation**: Implement Joi or Zod validation for API payloads to fail fast on malformed requests.
15. **Authentication Integration**: Configure Cognito User Pool clients for email, Google, and LinkedIn; wire up custom Lambda triggers for verification workflows.
16. **Profile Management Logic**: Store certification uploads in S3 with presigned POSTs and metadata tags for later verification.
17. **Search Indexing**: Stream DynamoDB updates to OpenSearch using Lambda consumers that denormalize profile data for search filters.
18. **AI Recommendations**: Create a SageMaker endpoint that consumes historical booking data; wrap invocations with circuit breakers (Polly.js) to handle timeouts.
19. **Booking Transactions**: Use DynamoDB transactions and idempotency keys to ensure atomic reservation, payment intent creation, and notification dispatch.
20. **Calendar Sync**: Integrate Google Calendar via OAuth with token refresh logic stored securely in Secrets Manager.
21. **Payment Escrow**: Implement Stripe Payment Intents with transfer groups to hold funds until interviews complete; reconcile payouts post-approval.
22. **Interview Sessions**: Utilize AWS Chime SDK for audio/video; manage session lifecycle through WebSocket API Gateway connections stored in DynamoDB.
23. **Recording Pipeline**: Trigger media capture to S3 and capture metadata events into EventBridge for downstream reporting.
24. **Reporting Service**: Chain AWS Transcribe, Amazon Bedrock summarization, and Puppeteer PDF generation via Step Functions to produce final reports.
25. **Analytics Stream**: Publish domain events to Kinesis; process with Lambda or Firehose into S3 for Athena queries and QuickSight dashboards.

## Frontend Development (26–35)
26. **React Setup**: Scaffold the SPA with Vite + React + TypeScript for fast builds; configure absolute imports and environment variables via `.env` files.
27. **UI Library**: Adopt Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling and build a reusable component library documented in Storybook.
28. **State Management**: Manage global state with Zustand or Redux Toolkit; persist auth tokens securely using HTTP-only cookies or secure storage abstractions.
29. **Data Fetching**: Use React Query for caching API calls, optimistic updates, and background refetching.
30. **Accessibility**: Leverage Headless UI or Radix primitives to ensure keyboard navigation and ARIA compliance across dialogs, menus, and forms.
31. **Marketplace Experience**: Implement advanced filters, saved searches, and AI recommendation cards with skeleton loading states.
32. **Booking UX**: Provide multi-step booking wizard, calendar selection, and payment confirmation screens with real-time validation.
33. **Interview Room UI**: Integrate Chime SDK React components, Monaco editor, whiteboard canvas, and chat with presence indicators.
34. **Reporting Dashboard**: Offer interactive visualizations (charts, tables) for interview outcomes, ratings, and ROI metrics.
35. **Error Handling**: Implement global error boundaries and log client-side exceptions to Sentry or AWS CloudWatch RUM.

## Testing Strategy (36–45)
36. **Unit Tests**: Configure Jest with `ts-jest`; target >85% coverage across services and UI utilities.
37. **Mocking AWS**: Use `aws-sdk-client-mock` or LocalStack to emulate AWS services during unit and integration tests.
38. **Service Tests**: Validate booking conflicts, payment failures, and retry logic using jest each to cover edge cases.
39. **API Contract Tests**: Employ Pact or Schemathesis to ensure API Gateway endpoints comply with OpenAPI specifications.
40. **Integration Tests**: Run LocalStack-powered suites verifying end-to-end flows (profile creation → search indexing → booking).
41. **E2E Tests**: Configure Cypress (web) and Playwright (future mobile web) to simulate full user journeys, including AI recommendation acceptance.
42. **Load Testing**: Use Artillery or k6 to stress search, booking, and reporting endpoints with thresholds (<500 ms p95 latency).
43. **Security Scans**: Integrate `npm audit`, Snyk, and dependency review GitHub apps to block vulnerable packages.
44. **Static Analysis**: Run TypeScript `--noEmit` checks, ESLint, and SonarQube (if available) in CI pipelines.
45. **Performance Budgets**: Monitor frontend bundle sizes via `source-map-explorer` and enforce budgets in CI.

## CI/CD with GitHub Actions (46–55)
46. **Workflow Separation**: Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for lint/test and `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` for release pipelines.
47. **Caching**: Cache `pnpm` store directories using `actions/cache` to speed up builds.
48. **Test Gates**: Require `pnpm lint`, `pnpm test -- --coverage`, and `pnpm typecheck` to pass before deployments.
49. **Artifact Storage**: Upload frontend build artifacts and infrastructure plans as GitHub Actions artifacts for traceability.
50. **Terraform Pipeline**: Run `terraform init`, `plan`, and `apply` within `/infrastructure` using remote state in S3 + DynamoDB locking.
51. **Serverless Deployments**: Execute `serverless deploy --stage=${{ env.STAGE }}` per service with IAM roles scoped via OpenID Connect.
52. **Frontend Deployment**: Sync built assets to the S3 hosting bucket using `aws s3 sync` and invalidate CloudFront caches post-upload.
53. **Post-Deploy Smoke Tests**: Run `curl` or Postman CLI checks against health endpoints; fail pipeline if responses are non-2xx.
54. **Observability Hooks**: After deploy, call custom Lambda or API to annotate CloudWatch dashboards with release metadata.
55. **Rollback Procedures**: Automate rollback via `serverless rollback` and Terraform `apply` of previous plan; document manual steps for severe incidents.

## Production Hardening and Operations (56–60)
56. **Multi-Region Strategy**: Deploy primary stack in `us-east-1` and secondary in `eu-west-1` with Route 53 health checks for failover.
57. **Blue/Green Releases**: Use API Gateway stages or Lambda aliases with traffic shifting to enable canary deployments.
58. **Secrets Rotation**: Rotate Stripe and OAuth credentials via Secrets Manager rotation Lambdas at least every 90 days.
59. **Cost Optimization**: Monitor Lambda usage, enable Provisioned Concurrency for hot paths, and set DynamoDB auto-scaling to balance performance and cost.
60. **Compliance and Auditing**: Enable AWS Config rules for encryption, log data residency policies, and document GDPR/CCPA request handling in runbooks.
